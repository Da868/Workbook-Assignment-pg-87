# Workbook-Assignment-pg-87

The purpose of the assignment was to complete a scatterplot. Additionally, I needed to have the scatterplot output two columns for a CSV file. I was able to complete the scatterplot successfully and with data executed the scatter plot output grades and hours. Moreover, the question wanted me to answer the trend I'm able to hold find. The scatter plot revealed most studnets who studied longer than 11 and 12 hours were scoring 80 and higher.
